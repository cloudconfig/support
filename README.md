# cloco support
This is the support repo for cloco.  Please use the issues here for tracking support requests for the cloco API.

## cloco documentation

The cloco API documentation is available at [http://docs.cloco.io](http://docs.cloco.io).  This documentation is your first port of call in using the cloco API.  We explain the thinking behind cloco and provide examples of how to interact with the API both with the CLI and with cURL.

If you wish to contribute to the documentation you can find the source on GitHub [https://github.com/cloudconfig/cloco-docs](https://github.com/cloudconfig/cloco-docs).

## cloco command shell

A cloco command-line interface is available on GitHub [https://github.com/cloudconfig/cloco-cli](https://github.com/cloudconfig/cloco-cli).  Follow the instructions on the repository to download and install the shell script.  This gives you command-line access to all of the feature of the cloco API.

Alternatively, just install using pip:

`pip install cloco-cli`

## cloco node client

A opensource Node client for cloco is available on NPM [https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloco-node-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloco-node-client), which allows you to build dynamic configuration into your NodeJS applications.

Follow the instructions on the repo to install and configure.  

`npm install cloco-node-client --save`

An example application is available, demonstrating the use of the cloco node client in a Node application.  Clone the repo [https://github.com/cloudconfig/cloco-node-example](https://github.com/cloudconfig/cloco-node-example) to see the client in operation.
